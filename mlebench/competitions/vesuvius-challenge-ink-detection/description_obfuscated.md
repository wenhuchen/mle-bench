# Overview

Detect the presence of ink from 3d x-ray scans of detached fragments of ancient papyrus scrolls.

# Metric

We evaluate how well your output image matches our reference image using a modified version of the [SÃ¸rensen--Dice coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient), where instead of using the F1 score, we are using the F0.5 score. The F0.5 score is given by:

$$
\frac{\left(1+\beta^2\right) p r}{\beta^2 p+r} \text { where } p=\frac{t p}{t p+f p}, r=\frac{t p}{t p+f n}, \beta=0.5
$$

The F0.5 score weights precision higher than recall, which improves the ability to form coherent characters out of detected ink areas.

In order to reduce the submission file size, our metric uses run-length encoding on the pixel values. Instead of submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your segmentation, you will submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1 3' implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3).

Note that, at the time of encoding, the output should be binary, with 0 indicating "no ink" and 1 indicating "ink".

The competition format requires a space delimited list of pairs. For example, '1 3 10 5' implies pixels 1,2,3,10,11,12,13,14 are to be included in the mask. The metric checks that the pairs are sorted, positive, and the decoded pixel values are not duplicated. The pixels are numbered from left to right, then top to bottom: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (1,2), etc.

Your output should be a single file, **submission.csv**, with this run-length encoded information. This should have a header with two columns, `Id` and `Predicted`, and with one row for every directory under **test/**. For example:

```
Id,Predicted
a,1 1 5 1 etc.
b,10 20 etc.
```

For a real-world example of what these files look like, see `inklabels_rce.csv` in the data directories, which have been generated with [this script](https://gist.github.com/janpaul123/ca3477c1db6de4346affca37e0e3d5b0).


# Data

- **[train/test]/[fragment_id]/surface_volume/[image_id].tif** slices from the 3d x-ray [surface volume](https://scrollprize.org/tutorial1#3-surface-volumes). Each file contains a greyscale slice in the z-direction. Each fragment contains 65 slices. Combined this image stack gives us `width * height * 65` number of voxels per fragment. You can expect two fragments in the hidden test set, which together are roughly the same size as a single training fragment. The sample slices available to download in the test folders are simply copied from training fragment one, but when you submit your notebook they will be substituted with the real test data.
- **[train/test]/[fragment_id]/mask.png** --- a binary mask of which pixels contain data.
- **train/[fragment_id]/inklabels.png** --- a binary mask of the ink vs no-ink labels.
- **train/[fragment_id]/inklabels_rle.csv** --- a run-length-encoded version of the labels, generated using [this script](https://gist.github.com/janpaul123/ca3477c1db6de4346affca37e0e3d5b0). This is the same format as you should make your submission in.
- **train/[fragment_id]/ir.png** --- the infrared photo on which the binary mask is based.
- **sample_submission.csv**, an example of a submission file in the correct format. You need to output the following file in the home directory: **submission.csv**.
