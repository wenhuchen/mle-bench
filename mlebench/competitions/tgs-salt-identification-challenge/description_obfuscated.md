# Task

Segment regions of salt in seismic images.

# Metric

Mean average precision at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds. The IoU of a proposed set of object pixels and a set of true object pixels is calculated as:

$$\text{IoU}(A, B)=\frac{A \cap B}{A \cup B}$$

The metric sweeps over a range of IoU thresholds, at each point calculating an average precision value. The threshold values range from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05:¬†`(0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95)`. In other words, at a threshold of 0.5, a predicted object is considered a "hit" if its intersection over union with a ground truth object is greater than 0.5.

At each threshold value¬†ùë°t, a precision value is calculated based on the number of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP) resulting from comparing the predicted object to all ground truth objects:

$$\frac{T P(t)}{T P(t)+F P(t)+F N(t)}$$

A true positive is counted when a single predicted object matches a ground truth object with an IoU above the threshold. A false positive indicates a predicted object had no associated ground truth object. A false negative indicates a ground truth object had no associated predicted object. The average precision of a single image is then calculated as the mean of the above precision values at each IoU threshold:

$$\frac{1}{\mid \text { thresholds } \mid} \sum_t \frac{T P(t)}{T P(t)+F P(t)+F N(t)}$$

# Submission Format

Use run-length encoding on the pixel values. Instead of submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your¬†segmentation, you¬†will submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1 3' implies starting at pixel 1 and¬†running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3).

The competition format requires¬†a space delimited list of pairs. For example, '1 3 10 5' implies pixels 1,2,3,10,11,12,13,14 are to be included in the mask. The pixels are one-indexed\
and numbered from top to bottom, then left to right: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc.

The metric checks that the pairs are sorted, positive, and the decoded¬†pixel values are not duplicated. It also checks that no two predicted masks for the same image are overlapping.

The file should contain a header and have the following format. Each row in your submission represents a single predicted salt segmentation for the given image.

```
id,rle_mask
3e06571ef3,1 1
a51b08d882,1 1
c32590b06f,1 1
etc.
```

# Dataset

The data is a set of images chosen at various locations chosen at random in the subsurface. The images are 101 x 101 pixels and each pixel is classified as either salt or sediment. In addition to the seismic images, the depth of the imaged location is provided for each image.
